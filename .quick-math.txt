total amount of work = 120 hours

8 * 3 * 5 = 168 - 48 = 120 hour (if only working weekdays)
120 / 21 ?= 6 hour a day (if working over weekends)

120 / 10 = 12 days

120 / 24 = 5 days 

=====================================================
reasonably speaking, how much can you work each day?

8 hours of sleep

minus sleep: 24 - 8 = 16 hours 

minus eating: 16 - 1.5 = 14.5 hours

minus toilet: 14.5 - 1 = 13.5 hours

minus play/relax: 13.5 - 1.5 = 12 hours  

hence, 120 hours of workload require 120 / 12 = 12 days of time to finish
12 day == 2 weeks - one weekend

THEN YOU ARE OFF TO HOLIDAY!!!!!
